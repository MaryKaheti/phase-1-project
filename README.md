There are other sub categories including menstraul symptoms, menstraul hygeine, menstraul illnesses,
period poverty andsolutions to period poverty.
All this are enabled by a click function.
They are a grouped as a card and have a bright pink color as the background color.
## Products

Four products presented in a row.

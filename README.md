## Description
My project is an informative project on menstraul cycle experienced by all women.
The first event when you load my page is a onloader. It displays the text "Thank you for being here!!".
Then after clicking ok on it we have the navbar.

The first information is menstraul cycle which can be viewed with a click function.
Once clicking on it you are presented with the title , description and an image.
There are other sub categories including menstraul symptoms, menstraul hygeine, menstraul illnesses,
period poverty andsolutions to period poverty.
All this are enabled by a click function.
They are a grouped as a card and have a bright pink color as the background color.

Here we have a very small in quantity section or div as you may call it. 
Four products presented in a row.
